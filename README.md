Building AI course project
## Summary

   For the past few years, machine monitoring and diagnostics have become effective tools for early detection of failures and tracking their evolution over time. Continuous vibration monitoring has many advantages for companies that use industrial equipment or machinery:
- It allows for quick detection of problems and correction before they become serious, which can prevent costly production shutdowns and reduce equipment downtime.
- It helps improve equipment reliability and lifespan by identifying potential problems and correcting them before they cause damage.

   As a student in electromechanical engineering, I am particularly interested in the intersection of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and artificial intelligence; fields that have always fascinated me. My project idea is to employ artificial intelligence techniques to predict when and where maintenance should take place by detecting early signs of wear or machine failure to plan maintenance interventions before a breakdown occurs.
   
   Traditionally, this monitoring is done using vibration sensors to measure machine vibration characteristics. Vibration data is then manually analyzed or analyzed using pre-programmed algorithms to detect anomalies and defects. However, this project will use advanced sensors that allow for real-time processing and combine them with artificial intelligence. 
   Using machine learning, the AI model will become capable of detecting defects on its own before they occur. The AI algorithm will be based on a theoretical study using historical data and comparing it to current data to determine the possibility of anomalies in the near future.
   
####  - This project is already underway, with the theoretical part already completed, and now the adventure of applying this AI solution will begin.
