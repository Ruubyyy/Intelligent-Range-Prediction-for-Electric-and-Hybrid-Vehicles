Intelligent Range Prediction for Electric and Hybrid Cars - PROJECT IDEA
 
## Summary

As a student of electromechanical engineering, I am particularly interested in the intersection of mechanical engineering and artificial intelligence, two fields that have always fascinated me, particularly in addressing the growing concern among electric and hybrid vehicle users about the range of their vehicles on a single charge. My project concept is to employ artificial intelligence techniques to predict the driving range of electric and hybrid vehicles based on real-time data, allowing drivers to make informed decisions about when and where to recharge their vehicles.


## Background

One important issue confronting the automobile industry is the restricted driving range of electric and hybrid vehicles on a single charge. Range anxiety, or the worry of being stuck without a nearby charging station, might deter drivers from utilizing these vehicles for longer trips or in places with inadequate charging infrastructure.


## How is it used?

Drivers of electric and hybrid vehicles would use the technology, which would provide real-time range estimations via an app or dashboard display. This approach might also be connected with existing navigation systems to recommend charging stations based on projected range.


## Data sources and AI methods

This project would need data from car sensors, such as battery capacity, power usage, and driving behavior, as well as data from other sources, such as weather predictions and traffic conditions. The AI program would assess this data and anticipate the vehicle's range using machine learning and predictive analytics approaches. 

## Challenges

One of the problems of this research is that the accuracy of range forecast may be altered by factors such as geography, driving style, and battery age. Furthermore, the availability and quality of external data sources may vary based on the vehicle's location.


## Acknowledgments

There are several instances of range prediction systems available, such as the Tesla range calculator. 
The AI algorithms might be implemented using open-source technologies such as TensorFlow and Keras.
